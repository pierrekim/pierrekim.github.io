 ## Advisory Information

 Title: 112 ipTIME Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls models vulnerable with RCE with root privileges
 Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2015-iptime-0x00.txt.asc
 Date published: 2015-04-17
 Vendors contacted: KrCERT, ipTIME
 Release mode: Released
 CVE: no current CVE



 ## Product Description

 EFMNetworks ipTIME is the largest Korean brand of SOHO/small/middle entreprise Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls in South Korea
 with millions of devices deployed in the country. EFMNetworks ipTIME is occupying more than 60 percent of personal network devices.
 There are =~ 10 000 000 of ipTIME devices deployed in South Korea.



 ## Vulnerability Summary

 This vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and to get a direct RCE as root from the LAN side with a single HTTP request.

 This is a direct RCE against the Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls which gives a complete root access to the embedded Linux from the LAN side.
 The exploit doesn't work by default from the WAN (no HTTP or UPNP access from the WAN by default unless activated).
 If enabled on the WAN, the remote admin interface exposes the devices to this vulnerability.

 It affects 112 ipTIME products from 2009-era firmwares to the 9.52 firmware (built time 2015-03-23)) with the default configuration:

 Concerning the high CVSS score (10/10) of the vulnerability, the number of affected devices and the longevity of this vulnerability (6+ year old), we urge users to apply the new 9.58 firmware.



 ## Details

 The HTTP server allows the attacker to execute some CGI files.

 Many of them are vulnerable to a command inclusion which allows to execute commands with the http daemon user rights (root).

 Considering the huge potential impact against the South Korea networks, we are not currently planning to release working exploits.



 The exploits will be posted on my blog located at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/


 ## Vendor Response

 The vendor has released a new firmware version (9.58) for 112 devices:
