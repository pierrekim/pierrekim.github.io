## Advisory Information

Title: FreeBSD 10.x ZFS encryption.key disclosure (CVE-2015-1415)
Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/CVE-2015-1415.txt.asc
Date published: 2015-04-07
Vendors contacted: FreeBSD
Release mode: Coordinated release



## Product Description

FreeBSD is a UNIX-like operating system.



## Vulnerability Summary

FreeBSD 10.x installer supports the installation of FreeBSD 10.x  on  an
encrypted ZFS filesystem by default.

When using the encryption system within ZFS during the  installation  of
FreeBSD 10.0 and FreeBSD 10.1, the encryption.key has wrong  permissions
which allow local users to read this file.

Even if the keyfile is passphrase-encrypted, it can present a risk.



## Details

By default, the encryption key file is /boot/encryption.key.

Instead of being 0600, the permissions are 0644:

$ ls -la /boot/encryption.key
- -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  4096 Feb 17 15:16 /boot/encryption.key
$

This file is readable by a local user.

According to the vendor, a security advisory will be published, describing
the problem and the solution. It concerns:

    - stable/10, 10.1-STABLE
    - releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p8
